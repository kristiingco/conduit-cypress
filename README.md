# Conduit - E2E Testing with Cypress

## Project description

Conduit is a digital publishing platform designed to inspire authors to share their creations. It serves as a vibrant community where writers can publish their content, allowing readers to engage with, react to, and discuss the published works.

-   Following an author
-   Favoriting an article
-   Commenting an article
-   Browsing tags
